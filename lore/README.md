# Storyline

The Firework Wars story begins with an ordinary Minecraft world, before the discovery of creepers. Everything was peaceful, and countries co-operated and traded with each other.

This was until a failed experiment on a pig created the first ever creeper. The unfortunate scientists, not knowing what it was, approached the strange creature. It flashed white and fizzed. The explosion resulted in 6 casualties and 3 injuries.

Explosions were unheard of at the time, and so the scientists were terrified, but at the same time intrigued by the possible power that these creepers held.

Naturally, they repeated the experiment to create more creepers, trying to figure out how to harness their power for themselves.

It was discovered that if you kill a creeper (making sure that it doesn't explode), you could extract a new substance from them, originally known as blastpowder.

Experiments revealed that if you light this blastpowder on fire, it would explode, and the more blastpowder there was, the bigger the explosion would be. This simple fact revolutionised industry. Explosions were utilised everywhere - in mining operations, terraforming, even to cut trees.

To match this enormous demand, pig-to-creeper conversion factories and labs were founded. Pigs would be mass bred, then converted into creepers, and killed. Their gunpowder would be harvested and sold.

Eventually, a conglomerate known as the Blastpowder Company emerged above all other competitors. This was due to their existing supply of farm animals, as well as hiring some of the original scientists who discovered the creepers and blastpowder technology.

For a while, all was peaceful. The Blastpowder Company accumulated an immense amount of wealth, making the leaders very powerful. Power corrupted their minds and they sought out how to use their wealth and blastpowder technology to gain even more power over the world.

They began to design the first ever explosive weaponry. They created explosive arrows and even grenades. They used their wealth to hire an army of mercenaries, who stormed the Slimaean parliament and occupied it.
